  abstract = {Background The role and impact of RSV in the adult population is not well understood and comparative data of RSV infection, influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly hospitalized for respiratory infections is limited. Methods In a retrospective, monocentric study we analyzed data of adult patients with respiratory infections tested positive by PCR for RSV, Influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2 over a four-year period from 2017 to 2020. Symptoms on admission, laboratory results, and risk factors were assessed, and the clinical course and outcomes were studied. Results A total of 1541 patients hospitalized with respiratory disease and PCR positive for one of the 4 viruses were enrolled in the study. RSV was the second most prevalent virus before the COVID-19 pandemic and RSV patients represent the oldest group in this study with an average age of 75 years. Neither clinical nor laboratory characteristics differ clearly between RSV, Influenza A / B and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Up to 85\% of patients had risk factors, with COPD and kidney disease found particularly frequently in RSV infections. Hospital stay was 12.66 days for RSV patients and thus significantly longer than for influenza A / B (10.88 and 8.86, respectively, p {$<$} 0.001), but shorter than for SARS-CoV-2 (17.87 days, p {$<$} 0.001). The risk for ICU admission and the rate of mechanical ventilation were also higher for RSV than for influenza A (OR 1.69 (p~=~0.020) and 1.59 (p~=~0.050)) and influenza B: (1.98 (p~=~0.018) and 2.33 (p {$<$} 0.001)), but lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (0.65 (p {$<$} 0.001) and 0.59 (p~=~0.035)). The risk of hospital mortality for RSV was increased compared with influenza A (1.55 (p~=~0.050)) and influenza B (1.42 (p~=~0.262)), but lower compared to SARs-CoV-2 (0.37 (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion RSV infections in elderly are frequent and more severe than those with influenza A/B. While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 most likely decreased in the elderly population due to vaccination, RSV can be expected to continue to be problematic for elderly patients, especially those with comorbidities and thus, more awareness on the disastrous impact of RSV in this age group is urgently needed.},

Since 1977, four viruses co-circulate -- two A Viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two B viruses (B Yamagata and B Victoria). Type A viruses generally cause up to two thirds of annual infections, although single country studies have shown that B infections may be the predominant virus in the one year in four., Influenza vaccines have traditionally included the hamagglutinins and neuraminidases from the two circulating A viruses and either B Yamagata or B Victoria -- however, selecting the B strain for inclusion in these trivalent vaccines has variable success. The alternative approach is to include both B strains in a quadrivalent vaccine. Immunological studies of such vaccines show non-inferiority with a trivalent vaccine comparator, and significant superiority to the additional B strain., Quadrivalent vaccines are more expensive than trivalent preparations but theoretical evidence would suggest they are likely to be more effective and therefore play a much greater role in national immunisation programmes in the future.},

Additionally, secondary bacterial infections, caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, are one of the main complications and responsible for the enhanced morbidity and mortality associated with IAV infections. In spite of the significant advances in our knowledge of IAV infections, holistic comprehension of the interplay between IAV and the host immune response (IR) remains largely fragmented. During the last decade, mathematical modeling has been instrumental to explain and quantify IAV dynamics. In this paper, we review not only the state of the art of mathematical models of IAV infection but also the methodologies exploited for parameter estimation. We focus on the adaptive IR control of IAV infection and the possible mechanisms that could promote a secondary bacterial coinfection. To exemplify IAV dynamics and identifiability issues, a mathematical model to explain the interactions between adaptive IR and IAV infection is considered. Furthermore, in this paper we propose a roadmap for future influenza research. The development of a mathematical modeling framework with a secondary bacterial coinfection, immunosenescence, host genetic factors and responsiveness to vaccination will be pivotal to advance IAV infection understanding and treatment optimization.},

  abstract = {During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10--30\%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30--50\%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Influenza A viruses are known for persistent change that allows them to reinfect individuals. Recently, influenza B viruses have shown accelerated rates of evolutionary change, but their epidemiological consequences are not understood. We use quantitative methods to explore whether the unusually early start of the US 2019/2020 influenza B season relates to changes in the structure of influenza B/Victoria viruses. A combination of simulation studies and model-fitting exercises demonstrate that atypical 2019 influenza dynamics are better explained by changes in virus transmissibility and population susceptibility than by a competitive interaction between influenza A and B. Anticipating the timing of influenza A and influenza B epidemics could improve vaccination schedules, so that individuals have protection throughout the influenza season., The 2019/2020 influenza season in the United States began earlier than any season since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with an increase in influenza-like illnesses observed as early as August. Also noteworthy was the numerical domination of influenza B cases early in this influenza season, in contrast to their typically later peak in the past. Here, we dissect the 2019/2020 influenza season not only with regard to its unusually early activity, but also with regard to the relative dynamics of type A and type B cases. We propose that the recent expansion of a novel influenza B/Victoria clade may be associated with this shift in the composition and kinetics of the influenza season in the United States. We use epidemiological transmission models to explore whether changes in the effective reproduction number or short-term cross-immunity between these viruses can explain the dynamics of influenza A and B seasonality. We find support for an increase in the effective reproduction number of influenza B, rather than support for cross-type immunity-driven dynamics. Our findings have clear implications for optimal vaccination strategies.},

During the twentieth century there were three influenza pandemics. The World Health Organization estimates that there were 40,000,000--50,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1918 pandemic, 2,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1957 pandemic, and 1,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1968 pandemic. There has been concern since 2005 that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza could develop into a strain that can be transmitted readily from human to human and develop into another pandemic, together with a widely held belief that even if this does not occur there is likely to be an influenza pandemic in the near future. More recently, the H1N1 strain of influenza did develop into a pandemic in 2009, but fortunately its case mortality rate was low and this pandemic turned out to be much less serious than had been feared. There were 18,500 confirmed deaths, but the actual number of deaths caused by the H1N1 influenza may have been as many as 200,000. This history has aroused considerable interest in modeling both the spread of influenza and comparison of the results of possible management strategies.},

Improving over the classical SIR approach, we introduce a fourth class (C) for the cross-immune individuals in the population, i.e., those that recovered after being infected by different strains of the same viral subtype in the past years. The SIRC model predicts that the prevalence of a virus is maximum for an intermediate value of R0, the basic reproduction number. Via a bifurcation analysis of the model, we discuss the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. For realistic parameter values, the model exhibits a rich variety of behaviors, including chaos and multistable periodic outbreaks. Comparison with empirical evidence shows that the simulated regimes are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with reality, both for tropical and temperate countries. We find that the basins of attraction of coexisting cycles can be fractal sets, thus predictability can in some cases become problematic even theoretically. In accordance with previous studies, we find that increasing cross-immunity tends to complicate the dynamics of the system.},

We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage.

Method Databases were searched on 11 March 2016 for reports of influenza and factors associated with mortality or morbidity in humans, with no language restrictions. Pooled risks were estimated using random-effects models. Results Despite the heterogeneity of results across studies, known risk factors for serious disease were associated with both hospital admission and severe outcomes (critical care and/or death). In LMIC, but not in high income countries (HIC), pregnant women, people with HIV/AIDS and children {$<$} 5~years old (compared with older children) were at increased risk of a severe outcome. Also, although all patients with neurological conditions were at higher risk of severe outcomes than those without, children were at higher risk than adults and children who lived in a LMIC were at significantly higher risk than those living in HIC. Adults were more likely than children to suffer a severe outcome if they had diabetes or a hematologic condition, were obese or had liver disease. Asthma is a risk factor for hospital admission but not for severe outcomes. Conclusion Known risk factors for serious disease remain important predictors of hospital admission and severe outcomes with few differences between HIC and LMIC countries. These differences likely reflect differences in health-seeking behaviours and health services, but high heterogeneity between studies limits conclusions about the effect size.},

This study assesses potential differences in clinical severity and outcomes between these two influenza types. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of adult patients diagnosed with either influenza A or B. Using logistic regression, we identified predictors of adverse outcomes across demographics, comorbidities, and clinical parameters. Results The influenza A and B cohorts included 234 and 113 patients, respectively. In comparison to influenza B, influenza A patients were more likely to receive oseltamivir (43.5\% vs 27.9\%, p = 0.01) and showed similar rates of radiological abnormalities (27.8\% vs 24.8\%, p = 0.6). Age {$\geq$}65 years remained the strongest predictor of hospitalization (aOR 4.78, p = 0.01). Predictors of ICU admission included age{$<$}65 (aOR 3.18, p = 0.02), radiological bilateral involvement (aOR 19.4, p {$<$} 0.001), receiving oseltamivir treatment (aOR 2.43, p = 0.01) with a trend towards documented superinfection (aOR 2.56, p = 0.07). Short-term favorable outcomes were more common in influenza B (aOR 2.52, p = 0.02), whereas chronic respiratory disease and Charlson comorbidity index reduced likelihood of favorable outcomes (aOR 0.34, p = 0.04 and 0.25, p = 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed similar mortality rates at 90 days between influenza A and B types (13.4\% vs 8.7\%, p = 0.3). Conclusion Influenza type A and B exhibit distinct clinical trajectories and influenza B should not be neglected. These findings underscore the need for earlier diagnosis testing to promote earlier antiviral initiation and broader vaccination policies tailored to both influenza types.},

However, information on the clinical differences among pediatric patients infected with four recently circulating influenza viruses is sparse. Methods Medical records of pediatric patients ({$<$}20 years of age) diagnosed with influenza between the 2014--2015 and 2018--2019 influenza seasons were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features were compared between (I) patients infected with influenza A (FluA) and influenza B (FluB) viruses, (II) patients infected with FluA when A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) circulated dominantly, and (III) patients infected with FluB when B/Victoria and B/Yamagata circulated dominantly. Results A total of 1,588 patients infected with FluA and 964 patients infected with FluB were included in this study. Patients infected with FluB were older (P{$<$}0.001) and more likely to report sore throat (P=0.002) than those infected with FluA. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in the clinical symptoms, diagnoses, and outcomes between patients infected with FluA and FluB. Overall, clinical features of influenza patients were similar regardless of the dominantly circulated subtype and lineage of the virus. In children aged {$\leq$}2 years, patients infected with FluB were more like to experience lower respiratory tract infection (P=0.034) and hospitalization (P=0.001) than those infected with FluA. Conclusions There were no significant clinical differences among pediatric patients infected with four recently circulating influenza viruses, except that FluB infection tended to be more severe than FluA infection in children aged {$\leq$}2 years.},

While the lineages are serologically distinct, cross-reactive responses to both lineages have been detected. Viral interference describes the situation whereby infection with one virus limits infection and replication of a second virus. We investigated the potential for viral interference between the influenza B virus lineages.Ferrets were infected and then challenged 3, 10, or 28 days later with pairs of influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses.Viral interference occurred at challenge intervals of 3 and 10 days and occasionally at 28 days. At the longer interval, shedding of challenge virus was reduced, and this correlated with cross-reactive interferon {$\gamma$} responses from lymph nodes from virus-infected animals. Viruses from both lineages could prevent or significantly limit subsequent infection with a virus from the other lineage. Coinfections were rare, indicating the potential for reassortment between lineages is limited.These data suggest that innate and cross-reactive immunity mediate viral interference and that this may contribute to the dominance of a specific influenza B virus lineage in any given influenza season. Furthermore, infection with one influenza B virus lineage may be beneficial in protecting against subsequent infection with either influenza B virus lineage.},

Selection of strains for vaccines is now based on enhanced viral characterization using immunologic, virologic, and computational techniques not previously available.

Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble is the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021--22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022--23 season. Forecast skill and 95\% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degrade over longer forecast horizons.

The model incorporates distributed recovery and death rates and consists of integro-differential equations governing the dynamics of susceptible, infectious, recovered, and dead compartments. Assuming that the recovery and death rates are uniformly distributed in time throughout the duration of the diseases, we can simplify the model to a conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Another limiting case arises if the recovery and death rates are approximated by the delta-function, thereby resulting in a new point-wise delay model that incorporates two time delays corresponding to the durations of the diseases. We establish the positiveness of solutions for the distributed delay models and determine the basic reproduction number and an estimate for the final size of the epidemic for the delay model. According to the results of the numerical simulations, both strains can coexist in the population if the disease transmission rates for them are close to each other. If the difference between them is sufficiently large, then one of the strains dominates and eliminates the other one.},

Seasonal waves travel over large spaces covering many climatic zones in a relatively short period of time. The precise mechanism for this striking seasonal pattern is still not well understood and the interplay of factors that influence the spread of infection and the emergence of new strains is largely unknown. The study of influenza seasonality has been fraught with problems. One of these is the ever shifting description of illness due to influenza and the use of both the historical definitions and new definitions based on actual isolation of the virus. The compilation of records describing influenza oscillations on a local and global scale is massive, but the value of these data is a function of the definitions used. In this review we argue that both observations of seasonality and deviation from the expected pattern stem from the nature of this disease. Heterogeneity in seasonal patterns may arrive from differences in behavior of specific strains, emergence of a novel strain or cross-protection from previously observed strains. Most likely the seasonal patterns emerge from interactions of individual factors behaving as coupled resonators. We emphasize that both seasonality and deviations from it may merely be a reflection of our inability to disentangle signal from noise, be it due to ambiguity in measurement and/or terminology. We conclude the review with suggestions for new promising and realistic directions with tangible consequences to model complex influenza dynamics in order to effectively control infection.},

  abstract = {Background: Seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually in the United States (U.S.) and result in lost workforce productivity, strained healthcare services, and an annual economic burden of \$11 billion. While the U.S. has a comprehensive surveillance system, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes weekly updates on the outlook of seasonal influenza activity (FluView), there is a lack of literature analyzing seasonal influenza peak trends across and within regions of the country over multiple flu seasons. This study aimed to identify trends over time (2005-2015) in the timing and size of seasonal flu outbreak peaks, both across and within Health and Human Services regions.  Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted on U.S. national influenza surveillance data compiled and provided by the CDC. The study includes all persons in the United States (all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) who sought healthcare for influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2005-06 flu season through the 2014-15 season. Trends over time in peak timing and size were assessed overall (across all HHS regions) and within regions. The effect of the dominant subtype of influenza virus circulating on peak timing and size was also assessed. Results: Trends in seasonal influenza outbreaks revealed peaks that occurred earlier over time (p{\textbackslash}u3c0.0001) and increased in size over time (p=0.0012). The median peak week did not vary significantly by region (p=0.8541). Also, peak week and peak size were negatively correlated showing that earlier epidemics result in higher ILI rates. The timing of the epidemic differed depending on the dominant subtype circulating (p=0.0337) with subtype 2009 H1N1peaks occurring 3.5 weeks earlier than H1 peaks; however, subtype did not have a significant effect on the size of the epidemic peak (p=0.1984). Conclusion: A significant decrease in peak week and a significant increase in peak size were observed over time, revealing a trend of earlier and more intense seasonal flu peaks. Since earlier epidemics are correlated with higher rates of ILI, anticipating earlier seasonal peaks highlights the importance of vaccination and other flu prevention strategies being utilized early in the flu season},

Specifically, we suggest that infection with a novel virus strain, in people previously exposed to influenza viruses, can elicit a memory B cell response against conserved hemagglutinin stalk epitopes and/or neuraminidase epitopes. The anti-stalk and/or anti-neuraminidase antibodies then act to diminish the clinical severity of disease caused by novel influenza viruses and to eliminate seasonal virus strains.},

Despite the expanding recommendation of influenza vaccination, influenza has continued to be a major public health concern in the United States (U.S.). To evaluate influenza prevention strategies it is important that policy makers have current estimates of the economic burden of influenza. OBJECTIVE: To provide an updated estimate of the average annual economic burden of seasonal influenza in the U.S. population in the presence of vaccination efforts. METHODS: We evaluated estimates of age-specific influenza-attributable outcomes (ill-non medically attended, office-based outpatient visit, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and death) and associated productivity loss. Health outcome rates were applied to the 2015 U.S. population and multiplied by the relevant estimated unit costs for each outcome. We evaluated both direct healthcare costs and indirect costs (absenteeism from paid employment) reporting results from both a healthcare system and societal perspective. Results were presented in five age groups ({$<$}5\,years, 5-17\,years, 18-49\,years, 50-64\,years and {$\geq$}65\,years of age). RESULTS: The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the healthcare system and society was \$11.2\,billion (\$6.3-\$25.3\,billion). Direct medical costs were estimated to be \$3.2\,billion (\$1.5-\$11.7\,billion) and indirect costs \$8.0\,billion (\$4.8-\$13.6\,billion). These total costs were based on the estimated average numbers of (1) ill-non medically attended patients (21.6\,million), (2) office-based outpatient visits (3.7\,million), (3) emergency department visit (0.65\,million) (4) hospitalizations (247.0 thousand), (5) deaths (36.3 thousand) and (6) days of productivity lost (20.1\,million). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an updated estimate of the total economic burden of influenza in the U.S. Although we found a lower total cost than previously estimated, our results confirm that influenza is responsible for a substantial economic burden in the U.S.},

  abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9--35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

  abstract = {Previous exposure to influenza viruses confers partial cross-immunity against future infections with related strains. However, this is not always accounted for explicitly in mathematical models used for forecasting during influenza outbreaks. We show that, if an influenza outbreak is due to a strain that is similar to one that has emerged previously, then accounting for cross-immunity explicitly can improve the accuracy of real-time forecasts. To do this, we consider two infectious disease outbreak forecasting models. In the first (the ``1-group model''), all individuals are assumed to be identical and partial cross-immunity is not accounted for. In the second (the ``2-group model''), individuals who have previously been infected by a related strain are assumed to be less likely to experience severe disease, and therefore recover more quickly than immunologically naive individuals. We fit both models to case notification data from Japan during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and then generate synthetic data for a future outbreak by assuming that the 2-group model represents the epidemiology of influenza infections more accurately. We use the 1-group model (as well as the 2-group model for comparison) to generate forecasts that would be obtained in real-time as the future outbreak is ongoing, using parameter values estimated from the 2009 epidemic as informative priors, motivated by the fact that without using prior information from 2009, the forecasts are highly uncertain. In the scenario that we consider, the 1-group model only produces accurate outbreak forecasts once the peak of the epidemic has passed, even when the values of important epidemiological parameters such as the lengths of the mean incubation and infectious periods are known exactly. As a result, it is necessary to use the more epidemiologically realistic 2-group model to generate accurate forecasts. Accounting for partial cross-immunity driven by exposures in previous outbreaks explicitly is expected to improve the accuracy of epidemiological modelling forecasts during influenza outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Influenza, or most commonly termed the flu, is a common respiratory illness caused by viral infection. The circulation of this virus is found year-round but is more common during the flu season: fall and winter. In the United States, the number of reported cases begins to rise in October, reaches a peak in December, and returns to normal in April. Even though there are four subtypes of the Influenza virus, the seasonal flu outbreaks in humans are caused by type A and B viruses. eVision utilizes influenza data provided by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze influenza A and B cases throughout the flu season. During the 2019--20 flu season, the positive influenza cases reported in the US were between 36 and 56 million, which is the highest over the past six years. However, during the 2020--21 flu season which is the first complete flu season within the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported flu cases reduced drastically to 1,899; of which 713 were caused by influenza A viruses, and 1,186 by influenza B viruses. This indicates that the number of flu B cases was higher than that of flu A which was not normally the case prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was further observed that flu B reached its peak either at the same time or earlier than flu A which is also unusual compared to the flu trends prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This peculiar trend is also noted during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This paper reports the findings on deviation in the Influenza type A and type B trends during the circulation of Coronavirus in the US and Canada and provides possible reasons for these changes.},

  abstract = {The canonical susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) epidemic model is ubiquitous in assessing severity to guide interventions. It is typically applied to hierarchically aggregated data from distinct sub-regions. The introduced heterogeneity can lead to significant errors in estimated epidemic severity. We develop three analytical methods to extract SIR parameters from data, focusing on the reproduction number {$R$}0 that quantifies epidemic wave severity/strength. The estimation methods are applied to synthetically aggregated incidence data formulated by summing two independent SIR solutions of distinct {$R$}0 and separated by an onset delay, i.e. temporal offset. When applying the SIR model, we find that {$R$}0 estimates from the aggregated data can underestimate or overestimate the constituent epidemic waves' {$R$}0 even when the prediction appears to agree well with the incidence data, resulting in an erroneous unimodal epidemic dynamics. We find that for two epidemic waves, the stronger the trailing wave, the longer the temporal offset that maintains apparent erroneous unimodal aggregated data. In the special case of two equivalent epidemic strengths, however, the weaker the waves, the longer the offset that maintains apparent unimodal aggregated data. We provide sensitivity analyses with respect to noise perturbation of the data and illustrate our approach using historical influenza data.},

  abstract = {Influenza is a vaccine preventable disease and vaccination remains the most effective method of controlling the morbidity and mortality of seasonal influenza, especially with respect to risk groups. To date, three types of influenza vaccines have been licensed: inactivated, live-attenuated, and recombinant haemagglutinin vaccines. Effectiveness studies allow an assessment of the positive effects of influenza vaccines in the field. The effectiveness of current influenza is suboptimal, being estimated as 40\% to 60\% when the vaccines strains are antigenically well-matched with the circulating viruses. This review focuses on influenza viruses and vaccines and the role of vaccine effectiveness studies for evaluating the benefits of influenza vaccines. Overall, influenza vaccines are effective against morbidity and mortality in all age and risk groups, especially in young children and older adults. However, the effectiveness is dependent on several factors such as the age of vaccinees, the match between the strain included in the vaccine composition and the circulating virus, egg-adaptations occurring during the production process, and the subject's history of previous vaccination.},

Much attention has been paid to the virus's virology, pathogenesis and spread. In contrast, little effort has been aimed at identifying influenza's social origins. In this article, I review H5N1's phylogeographic properties, including mechanisms for its evolving virulence. The novel contribution here is the attempt to integrate these with the political economies of agribusiness and global finance. Particular effort is made to explain why H5N1 emerged in southern China in 1997. It appears the region's reservoir of near-human-specific recombinants was subjected to a phase change in opportunity structure brought about by China's newly liberalized economy. Influenza, 200 nm long, seems able to integrate selection pressures imposed by human production across continental distances, an integration any analysis of the virus should assimilate in turn.},
