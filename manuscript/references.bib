  abstract = {Background The role and impact of RSV in the adult population is not well understood and comparative data of RSV infection, influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly hospitalized for respiratory infections is limited. Methods In a retrospective, monocentric study we analyzed data of adult patients with respiratory infections tested positive by PCR for RSV, Influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2 over a four-year period from 2017 to 2020. Symptoms on admission, laboratory results, and risk factors were assessed, and the clinical course and outcomes were studied. Results A total of 1541 patients hospitalized with respiratory disease and PCR positive for one of the 4 viruses were enrolled in the study. RSV was the second most prevalent virus before the COVID-19 pandemic and RSV patients represent the oldest group in this study with an average age of 75 years. Neither clinical nor laboratory characteristics differ clearly between RSV, Influenza A / B and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Up to 85\% of patients had risk factors, with COPD and kidney disease found particularly frequently in RSV infections. Hospital stay was 12.66 days for RSV patients and thus significantly longer than for influenza A / B (10.88 and 8.86, respectively, p {$<$} 0.001), but shorter than for SARS-CoV-2 (17.87 days, p {$<$} 0.001). The risk for ICU admission and the rate of mechanical ventilation were also higher for RSV than for influenza A (OR 1.69 (p~=~0.020) and 1.59 (p~=~0.050)) and influenza B: (1.98 (p~=~0.018) and 2.33 (p {$<$} 0.001)), but lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (0.65 (p {$<$} 0.001) and 0.59 (p~=~0.035)). The risk of hospital mortality for RSV was increased compared with influenza A (1.55 (p~=~0.050)) and influenza B (1.42 (p~=~0.262)), but lower compared to SARs-CoV-2 (0.37 (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion RSV infections in elderly are frequent and more severe than those with influenza A/B. While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 most likely decreased in the elderly population due to vaccination, RSV can be expected to continue to be problematic for elderly patients, especially those with comorbidities and thus, more awareness on the disastrous impact of RSV in this age group is urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses circulate widely throughout the world and it is estimated that they affect between 5 and 15\% of the population annually. Since 1977, four viruses co-circulate -- two A Viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two B viruses (B Yamagata and B Victoria). Type A viruses generally cause up to two thirds of annual infections, although single country studies have shown that B infections may be the predominant virus in the one year in four., Influenza vaccines have traditionally included the hamagglutinins and neuraminidases from the two circulating A viruses and either B Yamagata or B Victoria -- however, selecting the B strain for inclusion in these trivalent vaccines has variable success. The alternative approach is to include both B strains in a quadrivalent vaccine. Immunological studies of such vaccines show non-inferiority with a trivalent vaccine comparator, and significant superiority to the additional B strain., Quadrivalent vaccines are more expensive than trivalent preparations but theoretical evidence would suggest they are likely to be more effective and therefore play a much greater role in national immunisation programmes in the future.},

  abstract = {During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10--30\%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30--50\%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Influenza causes more morbidity and more mortality than all other respiratory diseases together. There are annual seasonal epidemics that cause about 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. During the twentieth century there were three influenza pandemics. The World Health Organization estimates that there were 40,000,000--50,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1918 pandemic, 2,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1957 pandemic, and 1,000,000 deaths worldwide in the 1968 pandemic. There has been concern since 2005 that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza could develop into a strain that can be transmitted readily from human to human and develop into another pandemic, together with a widely held belief that even if this does not occur there is likely to be an influenza pandemic in the near future. More recently, the H1N1 strain of influenza did develop into a pandemic in 2009, but fortunately its case mortality rate was low and this pandemic turned out to be much less serious than had been feared. There were 18,500 confirmed deaths, but the actual number of deaths caused by the H1N1 influenza may have been as many as 200,000. This history has aroused considerable interest in modeling both the spread of influenza and comparison of the results of possible management strategies.},

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic's onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.},

Method Databases were searched on 11 March 2016 for reports of influenza and factors associated with mortality or morbidity in humans, with no language restrictions. Pooled risks were estimated using random-effects models. Results Despite the heterogeneity of results across studies, known risk factors for serious disease were associated with both hospital admission and severe outcomes (critical care and/or death). In LMIC, but not in high income countries (HIC), pregnant women, people with HIV/AIDS and children {$<$} 5~years old (compared with older children) were at increased risk of a severe outcome. Also, although all patients with neurological conditions were at higher risk of severe outcomes than those without, children were at higher risk than adults and children who lived in a LMIC were at significantly higher risk than those living in HIC. Adults were more likely than children to suffer a severe outcome if they had diabetes or a hematologic condition, were obese or had liver disease. Asthma is a risk factor for hospital admission but not for severe outcomes. Conclusion Known risk factors for serious disease remain important predictors of hospital admission and severe outcomes with few differences between HIC and LMIC countries. These differences likely reflect differences in health-seeking behaviours and health services, but high heterogeneity between studies limits conclusions about the effect size.},

This study assesses potential differences in clinical severity and outcomes between these two influenza types. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of adult patients diagnosed with either influenza A or B. Using logistic regression, we identified predictors of adverse outcomes across demographics, comorbidities, and clinical parameters. Results The influenza A and B cohorts included 234 and 113 patients, respectively. In comparison to influenza B, influenza A patients were more likely to receive oseltamivir (43.5\% vs 27.9\%, p = 0.01) and showed similar rates of radiological abnormalities (27.8\% vs 24.8\%, p = 0.6). Age {$\geq$}65 years remained the strongest predictor of hospitalization (aOR 4.78, p = 0.01). Predictors of ICU admission included age{$<$}65 (aOR 3.18, p = 0.02), radiological bilateral involvement (aOR 19.4, p {$<$} 0.001), receiving oseltamivir treatment (aOR 2.43, p = 0.01) with a trend towards documented superinfection (aOR 2.56, p = 0.07). Short-term favorable outcomes were more common in influenza B (aOR 2.52, p = 0.02), whereas chronic respiratory disease and Charlson comorbidity index reduced likelihood of favorable outcomes (aOR 0.34, p = 0.04 and 0.25, p = 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed similar mortality rates at 90 days between influenza A and B types (13.4\% vs 8.7\%, p = 0.3). Conclusion Influenza type A and B exhibit distinct clinical trajectories and influenza B should not be neglected. These findings underscore the need for earlier diagnosis testing to promote earlier antiviral initiation and broader vaccination policies tailored to both influenza types.},

Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble is the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021--22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022--23 season. Forecast skill and 95\% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degrade over longer forecast horizons.

  abstract = {Background: Seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually in the United States (U.S.) and result in lost workforce productivity, strained healthcare services, and an annual economic burden of \$11 billion. While the U.S. has a comprehensive surveillance system, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes weekly updates on the outlook of seasonal influenza activity (FluView), there is a lack of literature analyzing seasonal influenza peak trends across and within regions of the country over multiple flu seasons. This study aimed to identify trends over time (2005-2015) in the timing and size of seasonal flu outbreak peaks, both across and within Health and Human Services regions.  Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted on U.S. national influenza surveillance data compiled and provided by the CDC. The study includes all persons in the United States (all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) who sought healthcare for influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2005-06 flu season through the 2014-15 season. Trends over time in peak timing and size were assessed overall (across all HHS regions) and within regions. The effect of the dominant subtype of influenza virus circulating on peak timing and size was also assessed. Results: Trends in seasonal influenza outbreaks revealed peaks that occurred earlier over time (p{\textbackslash}u3c0.0001) and increased in size over time (p=0.0012). The median peak week did not vary significantly by region (p=0.8541). Also, peak week and peak size were negatively correlated showing that earlier epidemics result in higher ILI rates. The timing of the epidemic differed depending on the dominant subtype circulating (p=0.0337) with subtype 2009 H1N1peaks occurring 3.5 weeks earlier than H1 peaks; however, subtype did not have a significant effect on the size of the epidemic peak (p=0.1984). Conclusion: A significant decrease in peak week and a significant increase in peak size were observed over time, revealing a trend of earlier and more intense seasonal flu peaks. Since earlier epidemics are correlated with higher rates of ILI, anticipating earlier seasonal peaks highlights the importance of vaccination and other flu prevention strategies being utilized early in the flu season},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza is responsible for a large disease and economic burden. Despite the expanding recommendation of influenza vaccination, influenza has continued to be a major public health concern in the United States (U.S.). To evaluate influenza prevention strategies it is important that policy makers have current estimates of the economic burden of influenza. OBJECTIVE: To provide an updated estimate of the average annual economic burden of seasonal influenza in the U.S. population in the presence of vaccination efforts. METHODS: We evaluated estimates of age-specific influenza-attributable outcomes (ill-non medically attended, office-based outpatient visit, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and death) and associated productivity loss. Health outcome rates were applied to the 2015 U.S. population and multiplied by the relevant estimated unit costs for each outcome. We evaluated both direct healthcare costs and indirect costs (absenteeism from paid employment) reporting results from both a healthcare system and societal perspective. Results were presented in five age groups ({$<$}5\,years, 5-17\,years, 18-49\,years, 50-64\,years and {$\geq$}65\,years of age). RESULTS: The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the healthcare system and society was \$11.2\,billion (\$6.3-\$25.3\,billion). Direct medical costs were estimated to be \$3.2\,billion (\$1.5-\$11.7\,billion) and indirect costs \$8.0\,billion (\$4.8-\$13.6\,billion). These total costs were based on the estimated average numbers of (1) ill-non medically attended patients (21.6\,million), (2) office-based outpatient visits (3.7\,million), (3) emergency department visit (0.65\,million) (4) hospitalizations (247.0 thousand), (5) deaths (36.3 thousand) and (6) days of productivity lost (20.1\,million). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an updated estimate of the total economic burden of influenza in the U.S. Although we found a lower total cost than previously estimated, our results confirm that influenza is responsible for a substantial economic burden in the U.S.},

  abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9--35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

  abstract = {Influenza, or most commonly termed the flu, is a common respiratory illness caused by viral infection. The circulation of this virus is found year-round but is more common during the flu season: fall and winter. In the United States, the number of reported cases begins to rise in October, reaches a peak in December, and returns to normal in April. Even though there are four subtypes of the Influenza virus, the seasonal flu outbreaks in humans are caused by type A and B viruses. eVision utilizes influenza data provided by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze influenza A and B cases throughout the flu season. During the 2019--20 flu season, the positive influenza cases reported in the US were between 36 and 56 million, which is the highest over the past six years. However, during the 2020--21 flu season which is the first complete flu season within the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported flu cases reduced drastically to 1,899; of which 713 were caused by influenza A viruses, and 1,186 by influenza B viruses. This indicates that the number of flu B cases was higher than that of flu A which was not normally the case prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was further observed that flu B reached its peak either at the same time or earlier than flu A which is also unusual compared to the flu trends prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This peculiar trend is also noted during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This paper reports the findings on deviation in the Influenza type A and type B trends during the circulation of Coronavirus in the US and Canada and provides possible reasons for these changes.},

  abstract = {The canonical susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) epidemic model is ubiquitous in assessing severity to guide interventions. It is typically applied to hierarchically aggregated data from distinct sub-regions. The introduced heterogeneity can lead to significant errors in estimated epidemic severity. We develop three analytical methods to extract SIR parameters from data, focusing on the reproduction number {$R$}0 that quantifies epidemic wave severity/strength. The estimation methods are applied to synthetically aggregated incidence data formulated by summing two independent SIR solutions of distinct {$R$}0 and separated by an onset delay, i.e. temporal offset. When applying the SIR model, we find that {$R$}0 estimates from the aggregated data can underestimate or overestimate the constituent epidemic waves' {$R$}0 even when the prediction appears to agree well with the incidence data, resulting in an erroneous unimodal epidemic dynamics. We find that for two epidemic waves, the stronger the trailing wave, the longer the temporal offset that maintains apparent erroneous unimodal aggregated data. In the special case of two equivalent epidemic strengths, however, the weaker the waves, the longer the offset that maintains apparent unimodal aggregated data. We provide sensitivity analyses with respect to noise perturbation of the data and illustrate our approach using historical influenza data.},

  abstract = {Influenza is a vaccine preventable disease and vaccination remains the most effective method of controlling the morbidity and mortality of seasonal influenza, especially with respect to risk groups. To date, three types of influenza vaccines have been licensed: inactivated, live-attenuated, and recombinant haemagglutinin vaccines. Effectiveness studies allow an assessment of the positive effects of influenza vaccines in the field. The effectiveness of current influenza is suboptimal, being estimated as 40\% to 60\% when the vaccines strains are antigenically well-matched with the circulating viruses. This review focuses on influenza viruses and vaccines and the role of vaccine effectiveness studies for evaluating the benefits of influenza vaccines. Overall, influenza vaccines are effective against morbidity and mortality in all age and risk groups, especially in young children and older adults. However, the effectiveness is dependent on several factors such as the age of vaccinees, the match between the strain included in the vaccine composition and the circulating virus, egg-adaptations occurring during the production process, and the subject's history of previous vaccination.},

Much attention has been paid to the virus's virology, pathogenesis and spread. In contrast, little effort has been aimed at identifying influenza's social origins. In this article, I review H5N1's phylogeographic properties, including mechanisms for its evolving virulence. The novel contribution here is the attempt to integrate these with the political economies of agribusiness and global finance. Particular effort is made to explain why H5N1 emerged in southern China in 1997. It appears the region's reservoir of near-human-specific recombinants was subjected to a phase change in opportunity structure brought about by China's newly liberalized economy. Influenza, 200 nm long, seems able to integrate selection pressures imposed by human production across continental distances, an integration any analysis of the virus should assimilate in turn.},
